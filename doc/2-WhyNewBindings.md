This project includes FFI bindings to Cairo and FreeType that do not depend on the bindings that exist in Pharo. 

Why rewriting the bindings? What's different?

- Document Pharo code to ease a developer to link with the C API counterpart. 
- Offer direct access to the raw C API of the bound libraries. (See note below)
- [Cairo](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/cairo/cairo): 
  - Focus on using the Cairo API smartly, avoiding redundant calls and early OO abstractions.
  - It doesn't rely on the "Surface Plugin", like Sparta-Cairo, unlike Athens-Cairo.
- [FreeType](https://freetype.org/):
  - Only cover a small subset of the FreeType API that Cairo needs to draw text.
  - Support color bitmap fonts (emoji)

Additionally, we provide FFI bindings to a library that didn't had any support on Pharo yet: [Harfbuzz](https://harfbuzz.github.io/).
This library "converts a sequence of Unicode input into properly formatted and positioned glyph outputâ€”for any writing system and language."
With Harfbuzz, we get access to advanced information stored in font files, such as ligatures, that Cairo and FreeType don't get.
